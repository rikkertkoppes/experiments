Goal
----

- model an entity that can move around in a world when certain motor neurons are fired
- model a "stomach" that starts fireing "hunger" signals when energy is low
- connect the hunger signal to the motor neurons, so start moving when hungry
- we may also implement "pain" signals that change the way motor neurons are fired when the entity hits a wall
- lower the "hunger" signal when the entity hits food

This is basically an AI playing snake (ignoring the "bite tail problem")
