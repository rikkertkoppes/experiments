Experiment 1: Voronoi
===========

Goal:
-----

- Randomly seed a rectangle with cells
- calculate nearest neughbors using voronoi
- create an in memory network (2D)
- visualize the network
- allow propagation of signals

Observations
--------

- non-regular network results in interesting behaviour. Bits of activity pop up in unexpected places
- firing from multiple spots sometimes leads to lingering activity in the middle
- every activity dies off after some time
