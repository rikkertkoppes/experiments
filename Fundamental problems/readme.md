- 300e9 neurons
- 3e9 pattern recognizers (100 neurons per PR)
- 500.000 cortical columns
- 60.000 PR per column
- fireing frequency about 100Hz

The main problem is that they all work in parallel. We have a factor ~1000 to go to accurately simulate this (according to <https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/de/-/a-simulated-mouse-brain-in-a-virtual-mouse-bo-2>)
