<h1>Counting (count.ts - positive integer math)</h1>

<p>Goal: build up basic math from the principle of counting</p>

<p>Created two implementation. One functional, based around function composition (<code>count.ts</code>). The other is a rule based system based on regular expression string replacement (<code>rules.ts</code>).</p>

<h2>Observations:</h2>

<ul>
<li>defined symbols for decimal numbers, they can be any base and any symbol and it works fine</li>
<li>defined symbols for roman numbers, these are somewhat different, yet still simple</li>
<li>it is possible to set up basic positive integer math using substitution rules alone</li>
</ul>

<h2>Demo's</h2>

<h3>Decimals</h3>

<p>Basic positive integer math (including 0), using string substitution.</p>

<p>These are the rules for incrementing numbers:</p>

<pre><code>rule(/inc\(\)/, '1');
rule(/inc\((\d*)0\)/, '$11');
rule(/inc\((\d*)1\)/, '$12');
rule(/inc\((\d*)2\)/, '$13');
rule(/inc\((\d*)3\)/, '$14');
rule(/inc\((\d*)4\)/, '$15');
rule(/inc\((\d*)5\)/, '$16');
rule(/inc\((\d*)6\)/, '$17');
rule(/inc\((\d*)7\)/, '$18');
rule(/inc\((\d*)8\)/, '$19');
rule(/inc\((\d*)9\)/, 'inc($1)0');
</code></pre>

<p>And these for decrementing</p>

<pre><code>rule(/dec\(0\)/, 'NaN');
rule(/dec\((\d+)0\)/, 'dec($1)9');
rule(/dec\((\d*)1\)/, '$10');
rule(/dec\((\d*)2\)/, '$11');
rule(/dec\((\d*)3\)/, '$12');
rule(/dec\((\d*)4\)/, '$13');
rule(/dec\((\d*)5\)/, '$14');
rule(/dec\((\d*)6\)/, '$15');
rule(/dec\((\d*)7\)/, '$16');
rule(/dec\((\d*)8\)/, '$17');
rule(/dec\((\d*)9\)/, '$18');
//remove leading zeros
rule(/0*(\d+)/g, '$1');
</code></pre>

<h3>Romans</h3>

<p>Basic math using roman numerals. The only thing that differers from the decimal implementation are the rules for incrementing and decrementing.</p>

<p>These are the rules for incrementing</p>

<pre><code>rule(/inc\(([IVXLCDM]+)\)/, '$1I');
rule(/inc\(0\)/, 'I');
rule(/IIII/, 'IV');
rule(/IVI/, 'V');
rule(/VIV/, 'IX');
rule(/IXI/, 'X');
rule(/XXXX/, 'XL');
rule(/XLX/, 'L');
rule(/LXL/, 'XC');
rule(/XCX/, 'C');
rule(/CCCC/, 'CD');
rule(/CDC/, 'D');
rule(/DCD/, 'CM');
rule(/CMC/, 'M');
</code></pre>

<p>And these for decrementing</p>

<pre><code>rule(/dec\(0\)/, 'NaN');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]+)I\)/, '$1');
rule(/dec\(I\)/, '0');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)V\)/, '$1IV');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)IV\)/, '$1III');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)X\)/, '$1IX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)IX\)/, '$1VIII');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)L\)/, '$1XLIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)XL\)/, '$1XXXIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)C\)/, '$1XCIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)XC\)/, '$1LXXXIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)D\)/, '$1CDXCIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)CD\)/, '$1CCCXCIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)M\)/, '$1CMXCIX');
rule(/dec\(([IVXLCDM]*)CM\)/, '$1DCCCXCIX');
</code></pre>

<h2>Doing math</h2>

<h3>Addition</h3>

<p>We can perform addition by iteratively incrementing one operand and decrementing the other until the second equals 0. Then another rule kicks in stating that a number plus 0 equals the number:</p>

<pre><code>rule(/add\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'add(inc($1),dec($2))');
rule(/add\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),0\)/, '$1');
</code></pre>

<p>Furthermore, we add a rule to rewrite normal math (<code>a + b</code>) in the format used in the rules (<code>add(a,b)</code>)</p>

<pre><code>rule(/([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\s?\+\s?([0-9IVXLCDM]+)/, 'add($1,$2)');
</code></pre>

<p>The substitution sequence goes like this</p>

<pre><code>4 + 3       //input
add(4,3)    //3rd rule
add(5,2)    //1st rule
add(6,1)    //1st rule
add(7,0)    //1st rule
7           //2nd rule
</code></pre>

<h3>Subtraction</h3>

<p>This is basically the same as addition, decrement the first number and the second number until the second is 0. Then another rule kicks in that returns the number itself.</p>

<pre><code>rule(/sub\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'sub(dec($1),dec($2))');
rule(/sub\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),0\)/, '$1');
</code></pre>

<p>Note that you can't go below 0, to the first number should be greater than or equal to the second</p>

<pre><code>rule(/sub\(NaN,([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'NaN');
</code></pre>

<p>Also, there is a rule that rewrites normal math in the representation used here:</p>

<pre><code>rule(/([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\s?\-\s?([0-9IVXLCDM]+)/, 'sub($1,$2)');
</code></pre>

<p>The substitution sequence goes like this</p>

<pre><code>4 - 3       //input
sub(4,3)    //4rd rule
sub(3,2)    //1st rule
sub(2,1)    //1st rule
sub(1,0)    //1st rule
1           //2nd rule
</code></pre>

<h3>Multiplication</h3>

<p>This is done by repeated addition:</p>

<pre><code>rule(/mul\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'mul($1,dec($2),add($1,$3))');
rule(/mul\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),0,([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, '$2');
rule(/mul\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'mul($1,$2,0)');
</code></pre>

<p>And math rewriting</p>

<pre><code>rule(/([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\s?\*\s?([0-9IVXLCDM]+)/, 'mul($1,$2)');
</code></pre>

<p>Note that a subtotal is carried over as the third argument to <code>mul</code>. The substitution sequence goes like this:</p>

<pre><code>4 * 3           //input
mul(4,3)        //4th rule
mul(4,3,0)      //3rd rule
mul(4,2,4)      //1st rule
mul(4,1,8)      //1st rule
mul(4,0,12)     //1st rule
12              //2nd rule
</code></pre>

<p>Also note that the above substitution sequences are simplifications. What actually happens is more like this:</p>

<pre><code>...
mul(4,3,0)                          //multiplication 3rd rule
mul(4,dec(3),add(4,0))              //multiplication 1st rule
mul(4,dec(3),4)                     //addition 2nd rule
mul(4,2,4)                          //decrement 5th rule
mul(4,dec(2),add(4,4))              //multiplication 1st rule
mul(4,dec(2),add(inc(4),dec(4)))    //addition 1st rule
mul(4,dec(2),add(5,dec(4)))         //increment 6th rule
mul(4,dec(2),add(5,3))              //decrement 6th rule
...
mul(4,dec(2),8))                    //addition 2nd rule
mul(4,1,8)                          //decrement 4th rule
...
mul(4,0,12)                         //multiplication 1st rule
12                                  //multiplication 2nd rule
</code></pre>

<h3>Division</h3>

<p>Division is done by repeated subtraction. We first need a comparison rule to be able to define a stop rule when the numerator is smaller than de denominator:</p>

<pre><code>rule(/lt\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'lt(dec($1),dec($2))');
rule(/lt\(0,[1-9IVXLCDM]+\)/, 'T');
rule(/lt\([0-9IVXLCDM]+,0\)/, 'F');
</code></pre>

<p>These rules state that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Anything is not smaller than 0, including 0 (3rd rule)</li>
<li>0 is always smaller than anything, except 0</li>
<li>for all other numbers, compare the decremented numbers</li>
</ol>

<p>Then for division, we have</p>

<pre><code>rule(/div\([0-9IVXLCDM]+,0\)/, 'NaN');
rule(/div\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\)/, 'div($1,$2,0,lt($1,$2))');
rule(/div\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+),T\)/, '$3');
rule(/div\(([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+),([0-9IVXLCDM]+),F\)/, 'div(sub($1,$2),$2,inc($3),lt(sub($1,$2),$2))');
</code></pre>

<p>And math rewriting</p>

<pre><code>rule(/([0-9IVXLCDM]+)\s?\/\s?([0-9IVXLCDM]+)/, 'div($1,$2)');
</code></pre>

<p>The first rule prohibits dividing by 0, the second sets things up (much like multiplication). The third is a stop rule, returning the accumulated quotient. The last rule accumulates the quotient while the stop condition is not true.</p>

<p>The (simplified) substitution sequence is like this:</p>

<pre><code>13 / 4
div(13,4)       //5th rule
div(13,4,0,F)   //2nd rule
div(9,4,1,F)    //4th rule
div(5,4,2,F)    //4th rule
div(1,4,3,T)    //4th rule
3               //3rd rule
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes (rules.ts)</h2>

<ul>
<li>0 is treated as a special case, decrementing it leads to NaN since we are only working with positive integer math here</li>
<li>we may write the math rules directely in the normal format</li>
</ul>

<p>once operations are done a few times, a new rule can be learned that would skip the calculation
like</p>

<pre><code>mult(4,8) =&gt; 32
</code></pre>

<p>This would still allow all calculations, but speed up "known" calculations.</p>

<p>Note that rules need to have an order here</p>

<p>Also, the predicates (=&gt;) is just one example here. Rules need not be bound to only this predicate</p>

<p>The predicate may be "activated" by recognizing we are doing positive integer math. If we are doing Complex math, a pattern recognizer may see that and disable the whole group of predicates.</p>

<h2>Better rules</h2>

<p>Multiplication rules can be simpler, especially for large numbers</p>
