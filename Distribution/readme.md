Idea

Could we set up a simple neural network on the GPU? (see [automata](../Automata))

And then run it in the browser, allow lots of clients to connect, all contributing to the intelligence of the whole, each acting as a couple of pattern recognizers.

"Please expand my AI brain by opening a tab and lending me your gpu"

(note that hidden tabs don't do anything though)
