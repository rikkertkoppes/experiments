# A collection of experiments

This is a set of experiments in rule systems and AI by Rikkert Koppes

- [Counting](2.Counting)

## Vision

[Deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) achieves [great](http://www.wired.com/2012/06/google-x-neural-network/) [results](https://www.imageidentify.com/), also, other machine learning methods based on huge amounts of data work well. However, I think the key to [Artificial General Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) (AGI) is not lots of data.

I may have seen at most 10 cats before learning the concept. After that, I had no difficulty classifying even weird looking cats. I have a hunch ideas like [one shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_learning) is more to the point

Also, I think we need `networks all the way down`. We do have a number of network related tools, but to achieve a system that can adjust itself and its workings based on acquired data, we need a system where networks represent the data, the software and the hardware.

LISP is a programming language in which the language itself is represented as data, lists in this case. This is almost there. We need a language that is represented as graphs.

[CRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational-representational_understanding_of_mind) differentiates six representations

- logic
- rules
- concepts
- analogies
- images
- networks

In order to achieve AGI, a network based system needs at least to be able to represent these.

Rules are probably easiest to capture in graphs. A language like [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a nice example

[RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework) and the [semantic web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) provide a vast network of linked concepts.

Analogies I think can be implemented using a combination of generalization and pattern recognition

[PRTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_Mind#Pattern_Recognition_Theory_of_Mind) suggest the brain works as a hierarchy of pattern matchers
